# myStore

## Description

This is a backend of an online store. It tracks products through categories and tags. The user is able to see all items, search for item by id, create new item, update an item, and delete an item using insomnia. 

## Installation

The following commands will get the app up and running, all three in this order:
npm install
npm run seed
npm start

## Usage

Using Insomnia the user can make GET, POST, PUT, and Delete requests to manage the data.
